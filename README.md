# Homebrew tap for GNOME Planner

## Homebrew Tap 

First, Homebrew (http://brew.sh) supported third-party repositories, wisely!
You just have to add this repository as another tap URL, like this:

```brew tap amadeubarbosa/planner```

## GNOME Planner 0.14.6 Formula

GNOME Planner site: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Planner

Now, you can install GNOME Planner as simple as that:

```brew install gnome-planner```

# Dependencies

I used another *great* tap repository for libgnomeui from [aisipos/libgnomeui](http://github.com/aisipos/libgnomeui).
